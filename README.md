## Hi, I am Samyak Sheersh

I am a student of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. While this profile is primarily for storing my config (to say nothing of my incessant need to get everything perfect), I am currently learning some stuff so that I can redeem myself as a 'developer' who'd actually need a github profile.
